> *"It's 3 AM, I've been staring at the Roundtable Hold wall for two hours... and I just found the mirror. Welcome to the real endgame – fashion."*

## 🎯 TL;DR (for the tired ones)

- Beat two expeditions → Unlock wardrobe room  
- Defeat 4 Nightlords → Access mirror  
- Finish Remembrance quests → Unlock character-exclusive skins  
- Kill final boss → Buy Dark Souls-inspired sets  
- All skins cost Murk (💸💸💸)

## 🧭 Step-by-Step: Unlocking the Wardrobe

### 1. **Finish Two Expeditions First**

You won’t even *see* the wardrobe room unless you’ve cleared both Tricephalos and one other expedition. Once done:

- 🏠 Go to **Roundtable Hold – East Wing**
- Look for a new door labeled “Wardrobe Room” (yes, it just appears one day like it pays rent)

### 2. **Defeat Four Nightlords**

Including **Gladius**, which is kind of a pain. But once four are down:

- A **Mirror of Transfiguration** appears in the wardrobe room
- Interacting with it lets you browse outfits and swap garb

📸 *The mirror is the real MVP. It doesn’t judge your fashion choices.*

## 💀 Remembrance Quests = EXCLUSIVE Skins

If you’ve done any character’s **full Remembrance questline** (like Revenant or Recluse), congrats:

- They each unlock a **one-of-a-kind skin**
- These skins are NOT buyable. You earn them. With pain.
- You’ll see them added automatically to the wardrobe

🔥 *Revenant’s skin? Straight ghost-core aesthetics. Would haunt again.*

## 🗡️ Defeat Heolstor for the Real Drip

Once you down **Heolstor the Nightlord** in the Night Aspect expedition, a whole new tab unlocks in the mirror:

- **Dark Souls-style skins** for every class
- Gritty, grimy, stylish-as-hell
- Each costs around **7,500 Murk**

You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Duchess dressed like she crawled out of Lordran.

## 💸 Skin Price Breakdown

| Skin Type                 | Cost (Murk) |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Dawn Skins               | 14,000      |
| Darkness Skins           | 35,000      |
| Dark Souls-Inspired Sets | 7,500 each  |

👉 *Yes, you will go broke. No, it’s not refundable.*

## 💰 How to Farm Murk (Fast-ish)

- Expedition boss kills = 2,000–4,000 Murk  
- Daily echoes (if you’re into that) = ~1,000 Murk  
- Sell duplicate relics = You guessed it, more Murk

🛑 *Do NOT waste Murk on random summoning eggs. Just trust me.*

---

## 📍 How to Change Skins

Once unlocked:

1. Go to the **Wardrobe Room** (East Wing, Roundtable Hold)
2. Approach the **Mirror**
3. Hit “Change Garb”
4. Cry over how cool Recluse looks in black

---

## 💤 Final Thoughts (and Eyebags)

Unlocking skins in Nightreign isn’t just for style—it’s a badge of survival. If you’re walking around in a full Revenant Remembrance skin, you didn’t *buy* that drip—you **earned** it.

And let’s be real: this game is dark, twisted, and punishing. Might as well look amazing while dying 87 times to Corrosion.
