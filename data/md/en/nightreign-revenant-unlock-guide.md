## 🌙 First Things First – What Is Revenant in Nightreign?

Revenant is one of the hidden unlockable classes in **Elden Ring: Nightreign**, and man, it’s worth every drop of sweat. Think necromancer meets support priestess with a touch of Silent Hill vibes. She's a soul summoner, a battlefield tactician, and—if you play her right—an MVP in multiplayer runs.

When I first stumbled into Revenant's unlock path, it felt like discovering a secret passage behind a bookshelf in Hogwarts (yes, I’m a Potterhead). The eerie setting, the lore fragments, and that boss fight… this wasn’t just gameplay—it was *ritualistic*.

## 🗝️ How to Unlock Revenant – Step-by-Step (With My Thoughts Along the Way)

> **Estimated Time to Unlock:** 1.5 hours (if you don’t die a million times like I did 😅)

### 1. **Unlock Duchess First**

You won’t even see the Revenant questline unless you first unlock the **Duchess** class. To do that:

- Finish the **first Nightlord boss**
- Return to **Roundtable Hold**
- Give the **Old Pocketwatch** (you'll find it near the collapsed crypt in Blackflame Chapel) to the **Priestess**

It took me a while to realize this old trinket wasn’t just lore fluff. If you’re the kind who skips item descriptions—don’t!

---

### 2. **Buy the Besmirched Frame**

Head to the **Small Jar Bazaar** merchant in Roundtable Hold (west wing). There’s a creepy vendor who sells a cracked mirror frame called the **Besmirched Frame** for 1,500 Murk. Buy it.

When I first bought this, I thought it was a furniture item. I mean… “Frame”? Really? Turns out, this thing is your ritual key.

---

### 3. **Find the Ghost (and Get Ready)**

After buying the frame, a ghost appears near the giant canvas in the east wing of Roundtable Hold. Touch it. Accept the dialogue prompt.

Boom—you’re teleported to **Limveld**, and this is where the *real* challenge begins.

---

### 4. **Boss Fight: Night Idol and Her Soul Squad**

You’re not just fighting one boss. You’re fighting her and her three ghostly summons:

- **Helen**: Swordfighter, quick and annoying
- **Frederick**: Tanky pumpkin-head with AoE smashes
- **Sebastian**: Giant skeletal mage with soul spears

**My strategy?**
- Start with Helen. She’ll ruin your day if left unchecked.
- Use terrain to kite Frederick.
- Kill Sebastian *last*—he’s slow but dangerous.

Once they fall, Night Idol becomes vulnerable. This part took me 4 tries, and my hands were sweating like I was defusing a bomb in CS:GO.

## 💬 Final Thoughts – Is Revenant Worth the Trouble?

If you’re into solo rushes and brute force, Revenant might not be your jam.

But if you enjoy complex characters, tactical play, and a bit of spectral flair? Revenant’s your spirit animal. It reminded me of old-school **Final Fantasy Tactics summoners**, mixed with the soul of **Bloodborne** aesthetics.

This isn’t just a class—it’s a mood.
