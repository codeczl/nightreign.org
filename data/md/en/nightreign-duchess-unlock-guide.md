# 👑 How to Unlock the Duchess Class in Nightreign – A High-Risk, High-Style Assassin

> *"When elegance meets lethality, that's where you'll find the Duchess waiting."*

## ✨ So... Who Is the Duchess?

In **Elden Ring: Nightreign**, the Duchess isn't your typical class. She doesn't come unlocked by default, nor is she handed out during the early-game handholding phase.

She's a hidden gem—an assassin class with a stage-worthy flair, a bit like if Lady Dimitrescu decided to learn martial arts and join the Nightfarers.

If you love high mobility, smooth animations, and making enemies whiff their attacks while you pirouette through their souls—yeah, Duchess is your class.

## 🗝️ How to Unlock the Duchess Class (Step-by-Step)

> **Time to Unlock**: ~45 minutes if you know where to go  
> **Warning**: The game won't tell you this exists. You have to piece it together.

---

### 1. **Complete the Tricephalos Expedition**

You'll need to finish the **first main Nightreign mission**, known as the *Tricephalos Expedition*. The key here is defeating the first major boss: **Gladius**.

I underestimated this guy and walked in like a God of War wannabe. Let's just say… I ended up looking more like a ragdoll on fire.

But once you beat him? You're one step closer.

---

### 2. **Pick Up the "Old Pocketwatch"**

After the Gladius fight, you'll find an item on the altar:  
**Old Pocketwatch** – it has no stats, no abilities, and looks useless.

**DO NOT SELL IT.**  
This item is your gateway to the Duchess. The item description is cryptic, saying:

> *"She dances through time's breath, waiting for a willing hand."*

(Yeah. That's Nightreign for "this unlocks something cool.")

---

### 3. **Return to Roundtable Hold and Find the Priestess**

Head back to **Roundtable Hold** and find the **white-robed Priestess** standing near the central stair.

Give her the pocketwatch. Don't ask why she reacts like she's been waiting her whole (immortal?) life for it.

After a short cutscene, she vanishes. And then—BOOM—**Duchess class unlocked**. Simple. Mysterious. Kind of poetic.

## 🩸 Duchess Class Breakdown – Should You Use Her?

Let's break it down like a Netflix character sheet:

- **Role**: High-mobility assassin / support hybrid
- **Style**: Blink-in, shred, blink-out. She doesn't tank. She *embarrasses*.
- **Best Stats**: Dexterity and Intelligence
- **Signature Skills**:
  - **🧍‍♀️ Magnificent Pose** *(passive)* – Grants a second dodge frame when timing is perfect.
  - **🎭 Restage** – Repeats last combo damage after a short delay.
  - **🎬 Finale** – Temporarily cloaks you and nearby allies. Use this to disengage or prep a team ambush.

If John Wick had a ghostly sister raised in a theater, this is how she'd fight.

## 💡 Pro Tips from My Playthrough

- Use light weapons like daggers or sabers. Don't weigh her down—she's built for speed.
- Pair her with **Executor** or **Flamelance** in co-op. She's great for disrupting enemy casts and creating kill windows.
- Practice spacing. Once you nail her dash-step, you'll be untouchable—like Elden Ring meets *Devil May Cry*.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts – Is Duchess Worth It?

If you like tanking hits, she's not for you.

But if you're that player who solo'd Margit at level 1 wearing only rags and sass, welcome home.

She's fast, gorgeous, and turns every fight into a ballet of blades.
