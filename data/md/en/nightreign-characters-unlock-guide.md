## 🧭 Full Class List – All 8 Nightfarers Explained

In Nightreign, there are **8 playable classes**, with **6 available from the start** and **2 hidden classes** that require unlocking via special quests.

🎮 Here’s a quick rundown:

- **Wylder** – A balanced all-rounder and beginner-friendly explorer  
- **Guardian** – Tank/support hybrid with high block and crowd control  
- **Ironeye** – Ranged DPS, master of bows and stealth tactics  
- **Raider** – Berserker-style melee with big damage and big risk  
- **Recluse** – Elemental magic user with explosive area spells  
- **Executor** – Precision-based parry & counterattack expert  

🔒 Unlockable hidden classes:

- **Duchess** – Agile assassin who specializes in stealth, evasion, and burst damage (Unlocked via Tricephalos quest)  
- **Revenant** – Soul-summoner support role with revive and ghost ally mechanics (Unlock Duchess first, then complete Revenant storyline)

## 🗝️ How to Unlock Duchess – The Blade that Dances

> If you like high-dex, blink-dash builds with flair, you’re gonna love this one.

### 🔥 What You Need to Do:

1. **Finish the Tricephalos Expedition** – This is part of the main storyline. Defeat the boss **Gladius**.
2. **Grab the “Old Pocketwatch”** – You’ll find it on an altar after the Gladius fight.
3. **Return to Roundtable Hold** – Talk to the **white-robed Priestess** and hand her the pocketwatch.
4. **Watch the Cutscene** – Boom! Duchess unlocked. No map markers, no journal hints. You’re welcome.

🎯 *Pro Tip:* The Duchess plays best with light weapons and timing-based dodges. Don’t try to tank with her, you’ll cry.

## 👻 How to Unlock Revenant – Master of Spirits

> Revenant is a soul-bending class with spooky summons and the best team utility in the game. Yes, better than Ironeye’s smoke bombs.

### 🔓 Steps to Unlock:

1. **Unlock Duchess First** – Yep, she’s a prerequisite. Lore reasons… probably.
2. **Buy the “Besmirched Frame”** – Go to the **Small Jar Bazaar** in Roundtable Hold. Costs 1,500 Murk.
3. **Find the Ghost in the East Wing** – After buying the item, a ghost NPC appears near a wall painting.
4. **Interact and Get Teleported** – You’re headed to **Limveld**, a spooky ruin with a brutal boss fight.
5. **Defeat “Night Idol” + Her Ghost Trio** – Beat the boss and her minions (Helen, Frederick, Sebastian).
6. **Return to Hold → Revenant Unlocked** – And just like that, you now command the dead.

🎯 *Pro Tip:* Use Revenant in co-op for max value. Her summon-heal-resurrect combo turns failing runs into team victories.

## ⚔️ Starter Classes – Use Them Before You Judge Them

Don't sleep on the base classes. They’re solid, especially early-game. Here’s how I rank them (subjective, sue me):

- **Ironeye** – Best for exploring and scouting.
- **Executor** – Once you nail the parry window? Chef’s kiss.
- **Recluse** – Big flashy magic if you don’t mind charge-up times.
- **Raider** – High risk, high damage. Great for speedrunners.
- **Guardian** – Team tank. Might be slow, but boy, does she block everything.

Wylder is your “jack-of-all,” but let’s be real—once you unlock Duchess, there’s no going back.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts – Is It Worth Unlocking All?

Yes.  
And not just for the bragging rights (though those are nice).

Duchess and Revenant **completely change your combat style**, open up new builds, and bring unique co-op synergies. Plus, Revenant’s passive ghost summon is just *so* damn cool.
