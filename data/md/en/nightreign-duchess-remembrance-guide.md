## 🧭 Prerequisite: Unlocking the Duchess Class

Before her Remembrance becomes available, you need to unlock the Duchess class:

1. **Complete the Tricephalos Expedition**
2. **Defeat the Nightlord boss and obtain the “Old Pocketwatch”**
3. **Return to Roundtable Hold and give the pocketwatch to the Priestess**

Once this is done, the Duchess becomes selectable, and her Remembrance questline becomes accessible in the **journal room** of the Hold.

## 🧠 Final Tips from a Guide Junkie

- Always talk to Wylder after major fights. He’s more involved than he looks
